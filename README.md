# Simple Command-Line Note-Taking Application

This is a simple command-line note-taking application written in Python. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and view notes, and it stores the notes in a file using the `pickle` module.

## Features

- **Read Notes**: View all your saved notes.
- **Add Note**: Add a new note with a timestamp.
- **Edit Note**: Modify an existing note.
- **Delete Note**: Remove a note from the list.
- **Save and Quit**: Save your notes to a file and exit the application.


  

## Usage

- When you run the application, you'll see a menu with options (1 to 5). Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

- You can add notes, edit existing notes, delete notes, and view your notes.

- When you choose to save and quit (option 5), your notes will be saved to a file named "notebook.dat" in the same directory as the application.

## Dependencies

This application uses Python's built-in libraries and does not require any external dependencies.
